AdminBar module for ProcessWire CMS/CMF
---------------------------------------

This module provides easy front-end admin bar for editing page content in ProcessWire.

## Credits

This module was originally developed by @apeisa. Additional development by Teppo Koivula.

## Installing the module

This module can be installed just like any other ProcessWire module: copy or clone the directory
containing this module to your /site/modules/ directory, log in, go to Admin > Modules, click
"Check for new modules", and install "AdminBar".

Alternatively you can use the module installer in ProcessWire's Admin to install the module.

## Permissions

By default AdminBar is visible only for superusers only. If you want to grant non-superusers access
to AdminBar, please add permission "adminbar" to their role(s).

If you are upgrading from an older version of AdminBar, you may need to uninstall and then reinstall
the module in order to see that permission. Alternatively you can add this permission manually: just
provide "adminbar" as the name of the permission (the label doesn't really matter).
