AdminBar for ProcessWire

// INSTALLATION
Just put all files into /site/modules/AdminBar/ folder, then go admin -> modules -> and install AdminBar

// CURRENT ISSUES
-IE9: while collapsed only small part of the right side is showing
-IE9: while scrolling down, admin bar moves further away from top
-> probably problems with other versions of IE

// BROWSER SUPPORT
-IE7-9
-FF3+
-Webkit family (Chrome, Safari)
-Opera (?)
-Since this is admin only module, I see no reason to support IE6
